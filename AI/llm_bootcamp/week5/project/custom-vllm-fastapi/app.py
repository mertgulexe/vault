# - max_num_batched_tokens: Sets the maximum number of tokens that can be processed 
# in a single batch. Make sure to accommodate for the memory constraints of GPU hosting the application.
# - max_num_seqs: Limits the maximum number of sequences that can 
# be processed concurrently. Smaller numbers will reduce the memory pressure on the GPU.
# - gpu_memory_utilization: Sets the target GPU memory utilization. 
# Adjust to make more efficient use of available GPU memory.
# - max_model_len: Specifies the maximum sequence length the model can handle.
# - enforce_eager: Disables or enables CUDA graph optimization. This can be useful 
# for debugging or when CUDA graph optimization causes issues.
# - dtype='half': Sets the data type for model parameters to half-precision 
# (float16). This reduces memory usage and can speed up computations, especially on GPUs with good half-precision performance.
